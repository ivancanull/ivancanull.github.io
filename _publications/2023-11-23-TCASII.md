This brief introduces a machine learning based framework to model FinFET’s I-V and C-V curves with artificial neural networks and to further optimize FinFET’s performance on DC and AC characteristics. Our ML-based device model for FinFETs takes Vgs and other nine parameters that define geometry, doping, stress, and work function profile as input variables. Experimental results show that our ML-based device model can predict current and capacitance accurately. Besides, the proposed ML-based performance optimization flow is a promising alternative to the traditional design of experiment method based on technology computer-aided design simulations. Our optimization flow can locate optimized device features accurately and require fewer simulations. Our work demonstrates that ML can perform compact modeling of advanced devices with high accuracy, and the trained ANN models can accelerate performance optimization.
